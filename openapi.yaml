  title: File Editor Plugin
  description: |
    A plugin that allows the user to read and edit files for projects.
    It can list, read, write and delete files for a specific project.
    Edits are made by replacing the contents of the file.
    File lines shouldn't be shown unless explicitly requested.
    Multiple files can be interacted with, individually.
    If a file is edited, it should be reloaded to check the edits and apply corrections if needed.
    The file contents should be shown in a text editor.
    If you do not know the name of the project, ask the user to select it from a list.
